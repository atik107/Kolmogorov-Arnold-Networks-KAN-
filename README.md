# Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) vs MLP for Image Classification

This project explores how variants of **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)** perform on image classification tasks compared to traditional **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)**. We evaluate both models on benchmark image datasets and analyze their effectiveness in feature learning and classification accuracy.

## üß† Motivation

KANs offer a novel architecture inspired by the **Kolmogorov‚ÄìArnold representation theorem**, which suggests that any multivariate continuous function can be represented using a finite sum of univariate functions. This theoretical framework allows KANs to learn expressive, adaptive transformations that may outperform standard MLPs, especially on high-dimensional structured data like images.
